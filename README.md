# fsto2015-demo
A demo app to accompany the FSTO 2015 presentation by Dejan Glozic. It uses PayPal's react-engine and react-router to demonstrate true isomorphic approach to modern Web apps. It also uses dust.js to spare React from rendering the entire page, and to enable vanilla HTML page composition.

## Installation
Run 'npm install' to get all the dependencies, then 'npm start' to compile the client side bundle and start the Node.js server.
